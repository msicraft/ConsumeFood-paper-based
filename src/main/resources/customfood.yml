# Custom Food
# default customfood.yml = https://github.com/msicraft/ConsumeFood-paper-based/blob/master/src/main/resources/customfood.yml
#
# The material of custom_food is currently only supported for player_head or edible food.
#
# If a value exists when creating custom food with player_head,
# a uuid is automatically generated when plugin is loaded or when using the reload command.
# Do not modify the created uuid (Changing the uuid will not merge with anything created before the change.)
##
# If Max_Consumable is true, it allows you to eat food with a right click when the food level is 20 or higher.
# But this doesn't play the food eating animation. So you can set cooldown.
# If Custom_Food_Max_Consumable is false, the cooldown will be applied to custom food with material player_head.
# This setting applies only to custom food.
#
# If you need custom model data, just add the data configuration.
# data is used for custom model data
#
config-version: 2  # Don't Touch This


Custom_Food_Max_Consumable:
  Enabled: false

# Available Type values: global, personal, disable
# If Type is global, all food cooldown is applied as global_cooldown value
# If Type is personal, the cooldown is applied for each food
# If Type is disable, cooldown is disabled
Custom_Food_Cooldown:
  Type: 'disable'
  Global_Cooldown: 3


# If Custom_Food_Block_Place is true, you can place custom food with material player_head
